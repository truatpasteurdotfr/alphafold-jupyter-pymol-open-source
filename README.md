# Jupyter extension for the alphafold docker image 
[![Docker](https://github.com/truatpasteurdotfr/alphafold-jupyter-pymol-open-source/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/truatpasteurdotfr/alphafold-jupyter-pymol-open-source/actions/workflows/main.yml)
## why?
- to be able to re-use the pkl/pdb files saved to display as on the colab page

## how
- based on the docker image produced for computing the predictions
- just adding jupyter and py3dmol from conda
- now with pymol-open-source (alternative to rebuild pymol from source at https://github.com/truatpasteurdotfr/alphafold-jupyter-pymol/)
